NaN in JavaScript stands for "Not A Number", although its type is actually number.

    typeof(NaN) // "number"

To check if a variable is of value NaN, we cannot simply use function isNaN(), because isNaN() has the following issue, see below:

    var myVar = "A";
    isNaN(myVar) // true, although "A" is not really of value NaN

<!--more-->

What really happens here is that myVar is implicitly coerced to a number:

    var myVar = "A";
    isNaN(Number(myVar)) // true. Number(myVar) is NaN here in fact

It actually makes sense, because "A" is actually not a number. But what we really want to check is if myVar is exactly of value NaN.

So isNaN() cannot help. Then what should we do instead?

In the light that NaN is the only JavaScript value that is treated unequal to itself, so we can check for its equality to itself using !==

    var myVar; // undefined
    myVar !== myVar // false

    var myVar = "A";
    myVar !== myVar // false

    var myVar = NaN
    myVar !== myVar // true

**So to conclude**, if it is true that a variable !== itself, then this variable is exactly of value NaN:

    function isOfValueNaN(v) {
        return v !== v;
    }

    var myVar = "A";
    isNaN(myVar); // true
    isOfValueNaN(myVar); // false
